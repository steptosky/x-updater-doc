Java client
======================

For using the x-updater system you should have the *X-Updater-Client.jar* file in the root folder of your plane. If you don't have it you can download the file here http://update.x-plane.org/ and place it into your plane folder. Then, if you don't have Java **8** runtime installed you have to install it from www.java.com, and run X-Updater-Client.jar, use your e-mail address from x-plane.org and license-key for your product.

If you can't run the *X-Updater-Client.jar* file you should search ``how to run jar`` in Google.

.. warning::
   The x-updater client works only with java 8 now.
   
.. warning::
   The x-updater system works only with the keys from x-plane.org

.. note::
   You can also download the latest version of your product directly from the store
